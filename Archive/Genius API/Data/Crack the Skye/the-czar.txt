Don't stay, run away 
Czarina has warned of the danger

You must escape into the deep black of the night 
Fight the devil inside 
Enemies poison deep within my second sight 
Wasting valuable time

Leaving material world behind 
I see your face in constellations 
The martyr is ending his life for mine
