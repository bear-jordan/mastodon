[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
It's gone away 
It's gone away 
It's gone for good 
Animal spirits come calling me home 
Through the tunnels of brilliant light 
The magnet of wisdom is pulling 
Burrowing faster the fabric of time

No escape 
Binding spirits 
No escape 
Trapped in time space

[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
Rapid descendants 
The wormhole is empty 
The center of Khlysty surrounds me 
The fire is dancing in a silvery sheet of breath 
Black robe 
Necromancing 
Summon the soul of the spectre
