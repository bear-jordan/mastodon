So we can always be around
It is hard to see
Through all the haze at the top of the trees
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the Earth falls all around

Faltering footsteps, dead end path
All that I need is this wise man's staff
Encased in crystal, he leads the way
I guess they'd say we could set the world ablaze

All that I have seen
Standing on the edge, the foot of precipice
Floating in the sea
Past the king of swords, quickly to the shore
The last baron

Cyanide he craves
Coursing through his veins, providing him with strength
To see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes, faith in mystic power
The last baron
