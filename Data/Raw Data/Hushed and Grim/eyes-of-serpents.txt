[Troy Sanders] 
All eyes forward 
See what's to be done 
Calloused as I am becoming 
Less and less of my own 
If I burn the bridges 
Leaving the ash behind 
There's no choice but to move on 
Within a heartbeat the dream is dead 

[Brann Dailor] 
All that I have sacrificed is leaving me and letting go now 
I don't want to leave you here alone among the wind and weeping 

[Troy Sanders] 
Circles I've broken 
Once, they seemed so clear 
Leaving the past I buried 
Deep in yesteryear 
This will bring back memories 
That I don't want anymore 
Always see reminders 
And now I close the door 
The illusion is gone, the end is here 

[Brann Dailor] 
All that I have sacrificed is leaving me and letting go now 
I don't want to leave you here alone among the wind and weeping 
If I could crawl beneath the earth and settle with the worms and dirt 
I'd steal the eyes of serpents soothing powers from the deep blue sea 

[Troy Sanders] 
Is this just our fortune or unexpected fate?
A betterment for all 
The trials we made are troubling, they smother me 
Lay me bare to dry 
Begging me to call it quits and go for broke 
Bury me as I fall 
To treat you as a part of me, it hollows you 
The story has to fold
