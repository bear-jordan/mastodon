[Troy Sanders] 
Another sinking stone 
Finds its way down below 
Resurface when only light will ever show 
And while I progress slow I'm soon to surpass you 
Entitled to all possessions I have adored 

[Troy Sanders] 
I feel pressure 
I feel the pressure 

[Troy Sanders] 
And all the faded bones 
Piling up high and low 
Returning to life once you can stand alone 
Don't get too close this time 
The depths of love haunt you 
It's dark inside where all my demons hide 

[Troy Sanders] 
I feel pressure 
I feel the pressure 

[Troy Sanders] 
Waiting with patience of eons 
Your presence fades into a memory 
Underneath a cloud of silence, you journey into the rift 
Will time defy the weight of you leaving us?

[Troy Sanders] 
I feel pressure 
I feel the pressure 

[Troy Sanders] 
Hold aggression 
Hold aggression
