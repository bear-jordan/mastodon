A thousand lights in the night 
Alone in the spectrum 
On this sand, I find 
And realize

The light will guide you alone 
I can position your way 
You're gonna make it

Enduring the tireless fight 
Death in slow motion 
I'm growing tired of this scene 
Echoes in your past 
The light will guide you alone 
I can position your way 
You're gonna make it 
You had it all 
Tomorrow's never fine 
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found 
You're gonna make it 
You had it all 
Tomorrow's never fine 
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found 
You're gonna make it

You had it all 
Tomorrow's never fine 
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found 
You're gonna make it 
You had it all 
Tomorrow's never fine 
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found 
You're gonna make it
