[Troy Sanders] 
A thousand lights in the night 
Alone in the spectrum 
On this sand, I find And realize 

[Troy Sanders] 
The light will guide you alone 
I can position your way 
You're gonna make it 

[Troy Sanders] 
Enduring the tireless fight 
Death in slow motion 
I'm growing tired of this scene 
Echoes in your past 

[Troy Sanders] 
The light will guide you alone 
I can position your way 
You're gonna make it 

[Troy Sanders] 
You had it all 
Tomorrow's never fine 
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found 
You're gonna make it 
You had it all 
Tomorrow's never fine 
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found 
You're gonna make it 

[Kim Thayil]

[Troy Sanders] 
You had it all 
Tomorrow's never fine 
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found 
You're gonna make it 
You had it all 
Tomorrow's never fine 
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found 
You're gonna make it
