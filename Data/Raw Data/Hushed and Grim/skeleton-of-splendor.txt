You reached two hands outward 
Two birds spreading our wings 
Today's arms turn numb 
When I turn it inward 
We live and breathe all your thousand words 
Now you sleep, we'll finish your work

You painted us with effort 
Always praising us high 
The day has come to face the storm 
As lightning strikes me in two 
We live the dream onward as it were 
Endless days we'll carry on as one 
There's no doubt of what we're her to do 
You laid it out, a promise of yourself
