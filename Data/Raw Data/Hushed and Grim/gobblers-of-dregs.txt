[Troy Sanders] 
Long and frayed 
Static surrounds us 
Break the free fall 
Safely land 
When man can climb to see 
His rejection 
Spirit'll burn 
Evaporate 

[Brann Dailor] 
I left you in the wind 
To pull the scraps together 
I'm the one who sinned 
There's more for me to weather 

[Troy Sanders] 
Complications 
Of loss and gain 
The grace he gave 
Is filling the void 
How to proceed 
With new direction 
As photographs 
Melt away 

[Brann Dailor] 
I left you in the wind 
To pull the scraps together 
I'm the one who sinned 
There's more for me to weather 

[Brann Dailor and Troy Sanders] 
Waiting 
For the sun to rise 
So I can 
Say my last goodbye
All that I needed from you was your warm embrace 
Turns out that was mine to give 
Fools play into broken plans 
Tuned straight from servants' hand 
Reaping ill-gotten gains 
Bleeding this love away 
Coming home to rescue me 
The fate of man resides in empathy 
Seems my foundation is shaking and giving way 
Look for my hand reaching up from this rubble and clay 
It's too late 
My heart's away 
It's too late
Reborn again 

[Brann Dailor] 
I left you in the wind 
To pull the scraps together 
I'm the one who sinned 
There's more for me to weather
