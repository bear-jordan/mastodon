[Brann Dailor] 
Oh, my dear 
Look what we've done here 
My greatest fear 
A pain with an anchor 
The taste of defeat 
Oh, my dear 
Look what we've come to 
We've shattered serene 

[Troy Sanders] 
I've turned the grief to medicine 
Into my mouth will enter 
The hardest pill 
I've ever had to swallow down 
As karma whispers 

[Brann Dailor] 
Oh, my dear 
The damage is done here I disappear 
A love with no anchor 
In the depths of the sea 

[Troy Sanders] 
I've turned the grief to medicine 
Into my mouth will enter 
The hardest pill 
I've ever had to swallow down 
As karma whispers
