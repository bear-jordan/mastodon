[Intro] 
Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace 

[Troy Sanders] 
Please excuse the madness 
Of the situation I am in 
Are we reunited?
For we both share the cause of this 

[Troy Sanders] 
You choose to apply logic 
It's hard to ply where there is none 
My destination's unknown 
Allow the man to walk in his shoes from here 

[Brann Dailor] 
Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace 
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes 

[Troy Sanders] 
Justifying all your control I cease to mourn what never could be 
No feeling's ever final Just another scar I wear and hold dear 

[Brann Dailor] 
Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace 
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes 

[Troy Sanders] 
Falling down and losing ground 
Save me from myself 
All I've seen and all I know I've not been this low 

[Troy Sanders] 
Now I stand up on my own 
Learning from myself 
Where I've been and where I'll go Still remains unknown 

[Brann Dailor] 
Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace 
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes
