Please excuse the madness 
Of the situation I am in 
Are we reunited?
For we both share the cause of this

You choose to apply logic 
It's hard to ply where there is none 
My destination's unknown 
Allow the man to walk in his shoes from here

Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes

Justifying all your control 
I cease to mourn what never could be 
No feeling's ever final 
Just another scar I wear and hold dear

Falling down and losing ground 
Save me from myself 
All I've seen and all I know I've not been this low

Now I stand up on my own 
Learning from myself 
Where I've been and where I'll go Still remains unknown
