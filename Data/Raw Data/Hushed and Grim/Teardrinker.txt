Within a bruised heart
I'll just say when 
Just one time before 
It will come again 
Little voice inside 
Inside my head 
Tell me when it's time to turn around again

I can see your face 
And I feel the pain 
And I feel the shame that I have let you down again 
People everywhere 
Not a drop to drink 
Not a dare to think about the damage I have done

Try to give up what weighs 
What weighs you down 
The only control you have 
Is all your own 
Do I fit the pieces 
Together again 
Or do I leave them lying on the floor?

Leaving you behind 
Is the hardest thing 
I've done 
Asking where did I go wrong?
I wonder what all of this makes 
Does fortune favor the bold?
I only know that leaving you 
Was the hardest thing 
To cut and run
