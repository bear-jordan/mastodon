[Brann Dailor] 
I wish I could run forever 
Not concerned if I am found 
I wish I had all the answers 
I wish I knew what went wrong 

[Troy Sanders] 
Whatever you say is too late 
Speak it before you run 
Waiting is just a mistake 

[Brann Dailor] 
I just need you to whisper 
Tell me all is well 
You deserve to be happy 
Not stuck knee deep in hell 

[Troy Sanders] 
Whatever you say is too late 
Speak it before you run 
Waiting is just a mistake 
It pains me to see you this way 
To erase you is what I fear 
You're swimming through my head, it keeps you near 

[Troy Sanders] 
But all we said was too late 
Still, you intend to run 
Chasing another mistake
It pains me to see you this way 
To erase you is what I fear 
You're swimming through my head 
It keeps you near 

[Brann Dailor] 
My love, so strong 
Washing the dirt away 
As the snakes all go to their holes 
My love, so strong 
Bathing in turpentine 
Until the flesh and bone come undone 
My love, so strong 
Deflecting the thoughts of strangers 
To reach the other side 
My love, so strong 
The mountains we made in the distance 
Those will stay with us
