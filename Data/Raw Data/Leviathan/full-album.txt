1. Blood & Thunder


I think that someone is trying to kill me
Infecting my blood and destroying my mind
No man of the flesh could ever stop me
The fight for this fish is a fight to the death

White whale - holy grail

What remorseless emperor commands me
I no longer govern my soul
I am completely immersed in darkness
As I turn my body away from the sun

White whale - holy grail

Split your lungs with blood and thunder
When you see the white whale
Break your backs and crack your oars men
If you wish to prevail

This ivory leg is what propels me
Harpoons thrust in the sky
Aim directly for his crooked brow
And look him straight in the eye

White whale - holy grail


2. I Am Ahab


There's magic in the water that attracts all men
Across hills and down streams
The turning of the tide
Outlook
Future bright
Selfish
Beauty shines
Light cloud rain drive on
13 years to this day red planet aligned
Into sight 60,000 years of light
Fascination with a mountain put to sea
Built to slay and conquer
All with teeth of beasts


3. Seabeast


If I stand around and watch them drown in a pool of gray
When we dive in I can surely say there's feud with force
Am I in your way? Please knock me down. Can I help you in?
When I'm not around let us all be found in certain ways

Dear Mr. Queequeg you have been informed your life's been saved
You are not a black-hearted vicious mess so it has been claimed
If this is the beast pulling us towards the east with mighty waves
Let us look inside and pull out all your pride you know it's up to us

Holding pasts in ash black earth
Bound by roots
Roots into sand
Grow towards the giver

There's an open wound placed upon my heart in anger's rage
If we open up a spirit, a spirit that can bleed
Ahab the leading lad we can trust his obsession carries them
Meet us at the temple healing all the crippled

Don't forget the maimed
Lower soul sent with gifts offering
Teeth of hope travel with
Child laid next to mother


4. √çsland


Given decision to live
Not taken
The flight towards the light
I'll stay in the lava for life
Erupting when gods take us all
Changing the peaks makes us pour
From the mountain and burn
The path of our time
Hail people of Iceland
Journey of a land anew
Ram as our liaison
Vision inspire and move
Awe holy island
Breed the lagoon to run free
Raw beauty is ruthless within the golden ring
Precision of Grungir
Spear of the Norse God Odin
Praise our Pagan Father
Founder of the Althing

Given decision to live
Not taken
The flight towards the light
I'll stay in the lava for life
Erupting when gods take us all
Changing the peaks makes us pour
From the mountain and burn
The path of our time
Ruler of sky's thunder
The honourable warrior
All divination
Beward the Hammer of Thor
Lava goddess
Ice and fire
Settling down
Ocean Geysir
Gullfoss
Heimaey '73


5. Iron Tusk


Straight line
Feel it burst liver and lung
Long and strong
'Til she spills her black blood
Center down
Vast the head body and tail
Shatter life
Physeter catodon
Culture vulture
Elephant graveyard
Culture vulture
Engage monster
Wreaking vengeance
Assault with all martial rage
Sail on


6. Megalodon


Myth or legend
Nymph tale washed ashore
Near the kraken sleepeth stirs coral and bone
Infinite city
No sexy sneer
Hideous creation
Human and animal
Banter songs of rudeness to be adhered
Not on rocks that glisten
Harps to listen
Comb hair
Tear right to pieces
Left to recess a watery grave
Sensing the blood of prey
Swimming in fear for life
Rolling over
Falling into jaws
Teeth that chatter
It distracts them all
The Fiji mermaid
She will let it know
Time is coming to feed and knaw


7. Naked Burn


Angels dancing with a mortal a sin
A giant born within a woman's womb
Nephilim walking through the forest breaking limbs
As we bow and give respect to the gods

Save yourself
Don't wait on me
My feet are sewn
Endless bottom

The church is burning from the inside out
Altars falling into ashes again
An eagle fly upon horizons with sight
Focusing on all our family and friends

Apologize
Can we rise above it
Climb the line
It's a good endeavor
The ships arrived
Let's sail into the weather
Our crying eyes

Save yourself
Don't wait on me
My feet are sewn
Endless bottom


8. Aqua Dementia


An invitation to clairvoyance
It's hard to stand around and watch while they ignore us
She is dumped on
Used as an ashtray
At the expense of an organized association
I see the stones in the path we laid
It's a question of tomorrow
We like to breathe the ancient wind that we have followed
A perfect fire to burn the land
Before they knew it
The sun had falledn
Boiling the water where the hydra's crawling
The righteous go in blazing fury
And we cleanse the earth to bring it down
Bring it down
And God will watch it burn
Releasing souls
Within the wrath we wait
To be dirt again
There is a flame I lit
I upon high


9. Hearts Alive


Taken down with hearts alive
Our hearts alive

Lurking dark underground
Descend to the bottom
Swim below eternally
Into the deep blue sea

Time and space
All alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes
Opening up
I can't stand
I can't breathe
Rolled fin out
Oil stripped
Hold is filled

Ocean coil
Water boils
He swims to the surface
Flame from mouth
Smoke he breathes
Enter the caverns of the deep

Time and space
All alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes
Opening up
I can't stand
I can't breathe
Terrified
Ghastly cry
Spiraled lives
Taken down
Taken down

The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she
Not for defeat
The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she
