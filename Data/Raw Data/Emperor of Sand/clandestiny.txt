Silent all your life 
Running without vision 
Hollowed out inside 
Wronging all that's right

There's no cause to be alarmed 
And no reason to escape from us 
There's no illness and no pain 
And no thought of any suffering

The road is long and bare 
No clarity, no light 
The moment came and swallowed us 
Blinding all our sight

We will keep you free from harm 
All you have to do is stand with us 
I will mend your wounded heart 
And restore the trust that you have lost

@1:24
[Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds] 
Give your life 
So I can breathe 
Save our lives 
It's all we need

We can lead you underground 
And devour your humanity 
Follow heat and follow sound 
To the end of your insanity

[Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds] 
Give your life 
So I can breathe 
Save our lives 
It's all we need 
Give your life 
So I can breathe 
Save our lives 
It's all we need
