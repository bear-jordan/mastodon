The elusive mystery 
Determined by the stars 
The stigma is valid, truth and fear 
The fear is real

It will set us free 
It took my Pa 
I stand in deliverance 
Waiting for destruction 
In a wake of blood

The awakening moment arrives 
Returning you at will 
The midnight hour prepares for truth 
The truth is real 
The truth is real

It's so far beyond my reach 
The crimson mask is rising black 
The last setting sun 
Will be seen in my dusted mind

Constantly burying our loves 
In the trench of this 
Mysterious despair 
It leaves us empty 
Clawing in 
Clawing in

Free us from this feeder 
Lead me in deeper 
To fulfil this seed that I grew 
Into at my birth
