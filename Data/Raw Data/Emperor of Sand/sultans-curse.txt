Tired and lost 
No one to trust 
Who is there to give the push?
All I have learned 
Straighten the curve 
Like a circle to return

The long embrace 
The smell of dirt and roses 
Under the sun 
No sign of bread or water 
I fall asleep under blankets of stars

Ice hit you cold 
Heat of surprise 
Bending mind can't realize 
Faith is in me 
End I can see 
Tears are strong as ten thousand tongues

My sweet mirage I bathe in sacred waters I kiss the 
Sky Floating in Sultans' daughters 
Memories of loved ones are passing me by 
Memories of loved ones are passing me by

Oceans of sand and rust 
Give way and yield my wake 
Oceans of sand and rust 
Give way and yield my wake

They're waiting inside 
They're waiting to wash your eyes out 
Their hands are alive 
Alive with a fervent anger 
Your feet have been tied and your tongue in your hand 
Death of a thousand ravens 
You're down on your knees 
You're blind as the 
Ancient Kingdom

Relive the ages of the moon 
Reeling the water close to you
