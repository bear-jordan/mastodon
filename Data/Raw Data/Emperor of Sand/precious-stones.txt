I hope the sun shows the way 
Don't crush my spirit today 
Reveal your precious stones 
So I can help myself

Don't let it slip away from you 
Don't waste your time 
If it's the last thing that you do

I dig through bone and skull 
Imagine black emerald 
I'm covered head to toe 
With diamonds in the rough

These snakes have nothing to say 
I want their heads right away 
I sharpen every blade 
And I give them all to you 
Yeah, I give them all to you
