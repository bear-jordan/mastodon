The game isn't done 
I feel the crawling and haunting upon us until you listen 
It never ends 
Enough is enough 
Taking your essence and use it to strengthen their own flesh and blood

Light calls to me from future and from past 
This kills me to know 
We cannot learn

Chronic illusions confusing conclusions 
Foster the culture, predict the deception 
Chronic delusions with caustic solutions
