[Brann Dailor] 
Running outside the 
Nazca Lines 
You know I see you all in white 
Hoping you'll grow the fruitful vines 
And the rain to give us life 


[Brann Dailor] 
Violence born within my mind 
I know it always takes its time 
Climbing inside the cosmic eye 
And forgive the enemy 

[Brann Dailor and Troy Sanders] 
I wonder who I am 
Reflections offer nothing 
I wonder where I stand 
I'm afraid of myself 

[Brann Dailor] 
Watching you crumble to the ground 
Made me want to run away 
Helping you find the golden crown 
Made it easier to stay 

[Brann Dailor and Troy Sanders] 
I wonder who I am 
Reflections offer nothing 
I wonder where I stand 
I'm afraid of myself 

[Brent Hinds] 
At the bottom of the mountain 
Unaware of my surroundings 
Separation from my spirit 
Let the trees fall where they may 

[Brann Dailor and Troy Sanders] 
I wonder who I am 
Reflections offer nothing 
I wonder where I stand 
I'm afraid of myself
