When the Sultan gives orders to take your head 
You must ride the winds to safety or you'll wind up dead 
Through the evil and darkness you make your stand 
Only skeletons of war will guide you by the hand

The battle that rages before my eyes 
Is no different than the one that lives inside my head

Silence growing loud 
Failure is not allowed 
Ancient Kingdom still remains 
Crumble slowly 
Ride beyond mortality 
Leaving beauty now

Silence growing loud 
Failure is not allowed 
Ancient Kingdom still remains 
Crumble slowly 
Ride beyond mortality 
Leaving beauty now 
Sparks explode into the air 
Live forever 
Ageless sounds, they never die 
And I will remain
