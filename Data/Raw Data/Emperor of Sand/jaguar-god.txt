[Brent Hinds] 
I ain't no good 
And I live by the wood 
They say I ain't bad 
I'm the best they have had 
And I know it ain't right 
But I'll fight my whole life

Just to prove that I was right 
The day it went down I was out on my path 
Not feeling so bad I'm a suspect now I'm a vagabond tramp 
Living out on the lam I live by the woods 
They say I ain't bad I'm the best that I've had 
And I know it ain't right 
But I'll fight my whole life 
Just to prove that I was right 

[Brann Dailor] 
Terrestrial fire ascending from underground 
Godspeed divine 
So we control the mound 
Shape shifter, spirits whisper 
Guide me through this black sorcery 
Flashing teeth 
Aggressive tendencies 
Cloaked beneath 
Silver redeems 
Smoking mirrors 
Black obsidian 
Tell us where to find the marrow 

[Troy Sanders] 
The prophecy 
Will be realized 
Lord of the near and the nigh 
Possessor of earth and sky 

[Brann Dailor] 
Guard your temple 
From destruction 
Make sure no one goes inside 

[Troy Sanders] 
The prophecy 
Will be realized 
Lord of the near and the nigh 
Possessor of earth and sky 

[Troy Sanders] 
It's right in front of me 
The throne of maladies 
It's right in front of me 
Your malignancy 

[Instrumental Break]

[Troy Sanders] 
It's right in front of me 
The throne of maladies 
It's right in front of me 
Your malignancy 

[Troy Sanders] 
It's right in front of me 
The throne of maladies 
It's right in front of me 
Your malignancy
