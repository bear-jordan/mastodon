Running outside the 
Nazca Lines 
You know I see you all in white 
Hoping you'll grow the fruitful vines 
And the rain to give us life

Violence born within my mind 
I know it always takes its time 
Climbing inside the cosmic eye 
And forgive the enemy

I wonder who I am 
Reflections offer nothing 
I wonder where I stand 
I'm afraid of myself

Watching you crumble to the ground 
Made me want to run away 
Helping you find the golden crown 
Made it easier to stay

At the bottom of the mountain 
Unaware of my surroundings 
Separation from my spirit 
Let the trees fall where they may
