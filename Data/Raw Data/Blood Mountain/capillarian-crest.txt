It's a shattered wave
Cosmogenic cycles
Universal dreams
The unseen essence

Energies refreshed
12 years of silence
Frivolous to moments
Shake the hand of lightning

You don't have to go
Escaping from the long way
And leave us here all alone
Carve
Carve out your soul
Lay it on the altar
And leave us here all alone

This river is running violence
A way to catch our breath
Rising from the mercury
We will climb to bestow our trust
Take away the anchor
Amplify the mystery
Inhale the earth and wind
Map out the plans to our test
