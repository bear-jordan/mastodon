1. The Wolf Is Loose


The hero of the gods
The crossing of the threshold
The belly of the whale
Refusal of return
Hollow eyes
Dry pale legs
Howling on
Through fields and graves
Language of the signs
Symbols to our sight
Guardian to thy throne
Take on form
Daylight
Hide the skin
Cut it off
Scatter ash in the wind
Shapeshifter rolling on winds of tyrants make
Fierce lore of fanged horn
Danger all the way
Night's sea reflection
The faces of bodies slain
Returning to the form of natural human's fate
Grown from the cold
Spirits unclean
Dealer of the days
The ice will thaw
As the soldier walks through the crimson side
Researchers of aftermath
Dispelling disarming man
One-toed horses subject of Genesis
And the immigrants
Fundamental side of a human mind
Hulder folk and fairies
So believe
The hero of the gods
The crossing of the threshold
The belly of the whale
Refusal of return


2. Crystal Skull


Guide a truth
Prevail and ride
Into the black hole
Searching the crystal
Making the veins bleed
The source of consciousness
Alive
Crystalline resonance
Into the black hole
Searching the crystal
Making the veins bleed
A deep breath before the plunge
One million voices
Dispelling
A thousand faces
Disarming
Running through the darkness
Holding hearts in my eyes
Falling short of gauntlet
Covered in blood-sucking flies
The touch is cold
I tore a path screaming through wind and blood
I will it all
Burning deep in my skull


3. Sleeping Giant


Earth has burst
Mountain flames
Moon beheld
Father snake
Mind control
Has left its nest
Shame on
Bulls roar loud
The fearless fall
Wooden vessel
Broken wings
Caught my killer
In my grave
Shame on
Eyes of grace
Kill again
Trapped in maze
Trembling fear
Head scorched brow
Perish the land
Shame on
A vast calm wilderness
The call to adventure comes
Lead and land atop this rock
Infinite path carved with unrivaled skill


4. Capillarian Crest


Capillarian gone away
Capillarian gone away
It's a shattered wave
Cosmogenic cycles
Universal dreams
The unseen essence
Energies refreshed
12 years of silence
Frivolous to moments
Shake the hand of lightning
Capillarian carnate
Capillarian carnate
You don't have to go
Escaping from the long way
And leave us here all alone
Carve
Carve out your soul
Lay it on the altar
And leave us here all alone
This river is running violence
A way to catch our breath
Rising from the mercury
We will climb to bestow our trust
Take away the anchor
Amplify the mystery
Inhale the earth and wind
Map out the plans to our test


5. Circle Of Cysquatch


Elephant spirits
Tower of ivory
Story of ancient deities
Seizure of the fleece
Protector of its place
Fly through dreamscapes
Of valleys gullies and spires
Herd across suicidal slopes
Changeless moonshines
Circle cyclops image
A race of one-eyed beings
All feared and shunned
Rakshasa demon
Seizure of the fleece
Protector of its place
Eyes all around you
Enter the labyrinth
Visions of the hunted
Beware the birchmen
Incisors thought to be
Skulls of us
Our release


6. Bladecatcher


[Instrumental]


7. Colony Of Birchmen


This forest is growing faster than I can tell
Cell structure eats away at a massive swell
Seems however I'm a victim of circumstance
Hunt for ogres and dwarfs
Lion slicer
Run with death
Run with death
White faces coming closer with every step
Earth envelopes taking breath without happenstance
Carve my teeth out ripping through the sheep's head curse
Hunter gatherer
Ridden from the cave
Run with death
Run with death
Gone away
My heart's gone away
Taking everything
My heart's gone away
Take it now
Hunt for ogres and dwarfs
Lion slicer
Run with death
Run with death
Gone away
My heart's gone away
Taking everything
My heart's gone away
Take it now


8. Hunters Of The Sky


Running faster than I ever have
Evading sharks of the sky
Death trap and I kill again
Dig through my own hives
Shelter from sky
Talon of raptor
Force-fed glass giant moth
Reaping fields of the flesh
Heavy hand thwart the scheme
Of the dominant nymph
Omen she brings
Carried on weathered wings
Fly reptile
Leather wings
Bones hollow
Petrified
Running faster than I ever have
Evading sharks of the sky
The earth's ashing floats
What is good for man
Cast us out into the known


9. Hand Of Stone


No one sees the difference in the land
Where the sky meets earth
Form horizons
Hand of stone
Arm of strength
Nature's fire
Fist of gold
Venom stains the lips and burns the tongue
With vengeance and hatred
Extremities forged in nature's fire
Unrelenting vigor
Carve the future
Feast or famine
Drink deception
The wells run dry
The need for temptation
Falling through brain field
Head for divide
The hand matches
The hand that leads the way
To kill the shepherd
Just to see his face
Heed the warning
Ingest the rotten bone
The hand that falters
The hand that turns to stone
Chew on the root that gives us sight
Cranium shatters
Feed the needles as they fall
The truth
The mask
Brain divided


10. This Mortal Soil


Floating in red again
A deepened soil
Nothing
Empty cup
Trade not known
Showing promise of a perfect land
No regrets for a fallen ground
The omen passed
Woman possessed
Reflect on the duties held
Oceans morph to dust
Chasing the timeline
Bolts of light flash
Original storm god
The atmosphere that floats above the earth
Is corrupt for man
This we know
What has dwelt within the early dawn has gone away
That's okay
Dig
Climb
Ancient elm
Root
Ride the vine of father ground our carving
The atmosphere that floats above the earth is corrupt for man
This we know
Circle
Made of ash
Betray her presence
Huntress
Gentle breath
Listen to the poison rose


11. Siberian Divide


Ice god shakes the earth
Destruction of the path
Sinking deeper in the snow
Eating bark with blackened hands
Swollen fingers frozen jaw
Warm teeth wrapped around my wrist
Frostbite eating away at our limbs
Slit the belly brontotherium
Climb towards vermilion snowbank fall
Station of the crosses prayer save all
Chewing bone
Euphoria
Land and sky
Shining skull
Ice field blanket land
Hunted beyond the fray
No direction known
Running with the band
Provisions wearing thin
Avalanche sweeps the land
Starvation setting in
Spilling all that's left
Should've kept the fruits from virgin's vine
Three-horned face
Pillar of red
Evil lives atop my crooked spine
Rosebush current flow
Carmine river go
Solar storms erupt on the sun
Ice fields blanket land
Snow queen
Hypothermia
Ice lips
Hallucination
Ice field blanket land
Hunted beyond the fray
No direction known
Running with the band
Provisions wearing thin
Avalanche sweeps the land
Landscape ebb 'n' flow
Think I felt the end of time
Skulls aglow as crystal shines
And starts to warm the empty climb


12. Pendulous Skin


Yeah
Float away

Known so low
You run away
Desolate us
Desolate all

No love is lost
You know we're weightless
Climb
Under my wing
Climb

Known so low
You run away
Desolate us
Desolate all

No love is lost
You know we're weightless
Climb
Under my wing
Climb

Known so low
You run away
Desolate us
Desolate all

Grown so slow
You run away
Desolate us
I'm sailing away
