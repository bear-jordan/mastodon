Through the ages, all the weary and the blind 
Facing the unknown 
Off the venom 
Center our lives 
Knowing not your own is unwise 
And 
I will return for more 
The light will lead you ashore 
Paralyzed by 
Paralyzed by 
Paralyzed by thorn inside 
To the angel 
Breathing on me from the right 
A guilt you'll never know 
From the devil 
Staring from the left hand side 
Souls to animal 
Recede your eyes 
Sulk in disgust 
When there is doubt look to the obvious 
And 
I'll decide what you will pay 
Changing your mind seals our fate

Open your eyes 
Take a deep breath and return to life 
Wake up and fight 
Fight for the love and the burning light
