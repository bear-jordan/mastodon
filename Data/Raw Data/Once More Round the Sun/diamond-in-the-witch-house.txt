Wide is the line 
Separates the rivers from the dirt 
All the while I wonder who's the one

Within the one and only eye 
Within the one and only eye 
Within the one and only eye 
Within the one and only eye

Can you see there's a child 
Standing idle by us in this mess 
Who am I to cause this emptiness

Willing the sea 
To cleanse my soul of all I've been 
To bring me free to this clarity 
Clarity

Trouble rolls in 
As the tides, they twist and make the turn 
Pain subsides and sweeps across the earth again

Willing the sea 
To cleanse my soul of all that I've been 
To bring me free to this clarity

Within the one and only eye

I'm standing deep in these waters 
Bleeding free and bent to drag us onto new visions 
Only loss fills my void 
Only loss fills my void 
Only loss fills my void

Only the void connects me 
With these mountains of dust, blood and soil 
The stones born in the flames of truth 
Demand a sacrifice 
A sacrifice 
A sacrifice 
Don't just bleed us and leave us to ourselves 
We will return so deeply harmed, and we will shatter you
And we will shatter you
And we will shatter you
