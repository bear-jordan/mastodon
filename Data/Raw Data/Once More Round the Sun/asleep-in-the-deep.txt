The moment you walked in the room my friend 
The demons, they all went away 
Be careful they're only asleep for a while 
Pretending there's nothing to say 
Throw salt in all the corners here 
Make sure you watch him leave 
Build up the walls around this house 
And dig out the rot in the floor 
Block out the entrance with brick and stone 
And mortar that's made from coal 
Crawl into this hole I've made 
Transform these feelings of fear

And I can't get you out of my mind

And I can't get you out of my mind

An ocean of sorrow surrounds this home 
I hope that we make it to shore 
As time chips away at the fortress walls 
Its seems that we weathered the storm
The sun begins to show itself 
Revealing victory
