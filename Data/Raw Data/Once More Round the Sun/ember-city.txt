[Troy Sanders] 
You walk with boundless grace 
Think old thoughts from yesterday 
All being lost in the fire 
You wandered and lost the way 
Someone's always left behind 
When the door of life closes 

[Brann Dailor and Troy Sanders] 
And you were slipping away 
What do I say to you 
What do I say to you 
And if I want you to stay 
What do I say to you?
What do I say to you?

[Troy Sanders] 
This moment I take for you 
Think of all we didn't do 
All seeking answers from this 
Hope to come out alive 
Standing still my hands are tied 
Our eyes open up to the sky 

[Brann Dailor and Troy Sanders] 
And you were slipping away 
What do I say to you 
What do I say to you 
And if I want you to stay 
What do I say to you?
What do I say to you?

[Brann Dailor and Troy Sanders] 
And you were slipping away 
What do I say to you 
What do I say to you 
And if I want you to stay 
What do I say to you?
What do I say to you?
