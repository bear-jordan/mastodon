Orange and black take me back to halloween 
I've given to the blind can't you see?
Gasoline runs through my veins, so don't you mess with me 
I couldn't tame that beast with a handful of meat

Just wait 'till that robe falls at my feet 
Cold and dilated like my memories 
Strange voices in my head, who could they be 
It's the master of disguise and he's breaking me

You will find spirits never rise 
Without warning 
Feel your fate as you come alive 
They're here to take you home

Crashing through the walls 
You're the one 
I want to see 
Bent all up on a moon-soaked night 
Death is riding with me 
Dripping blood with hell froze at my feet 
Use a razor blade to cut some lines 
Because now I'm going to speed
