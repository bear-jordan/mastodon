I can see what the world has done to you 
I can feel the weight, feel the weight 
I can see what this life has handed you 
I can feel the weight, feel the weight 
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine 
We won't let you slip away 
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine 
We won't let you leave this way

I can hear what the spirits are telling you 
I can clear the weight, clear the weight 
I can see all the wolves as they circle you 
I can crush the weight, crush the weight 
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine 
We won't let you slip away 
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine 
We won't let you leave this way
