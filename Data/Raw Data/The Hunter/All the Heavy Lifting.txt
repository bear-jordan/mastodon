Lift you up again 
Give you to the trees 
All sound and visions are 
What they ask of me 
Let's run fast through the fields 
Over mountaintops 
Let's swim through ocean water 
And we'll never stop

Just close your eyes 
And pretend that everything's fine 
Just close your eyes 
I'll tell you when

Can you show me 
Where to find the stream?
I've been told before 
That the water's clean 
Will you come with me?
Two of us can drink 
Move quick, we've got to hurry 
There's no time to think

[Troy Sanders]
Just close your eyes 
And pretend that everything's fine 
Just close your eyes 
I'll tell you when

[Troy Sanders]
We didn't come this far 
Just to turn around 
We didn't come this far 
Just to run away 
Just ahead 
We will hear the sound 
The sound that gives us 
A brand new day

Just close your eyes 
And pretend that everything's fine 
Just close your eyes 
I'll tell you when
