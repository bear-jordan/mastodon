The temple of bodies 
A building with souls 
Given the cosmos 
As we let go 
As we let go 
Locked in a dance 
Surrounding the moon 
This far from the clouds 
Stargasm flows 
Stargasm

Lead us by horses 
On the way to our graves 
Father the owl 
It is your faith 
It is your faith
Awake in the moment 
Awaken the heart 
Look to the spirits 
Stargasm glows 
Stargasm

And then we shift into overdrive 
But you're not here 
And your legs and the stars collide 
You're on fire 
You're on fire 
You're on fire 
You're on fire

Henged from the solstice 
Bohemian grove 
Flesh lies the altar 
As we let go 
As we let go 
Glasses are empty 
The owl has flown 
Sever relation 
Like you didn't know 
Like you didn't know

And then we shift into overdrive 
But you're not here 
And your legs and the stars collide 
You're on fire 
You're on fire 
You're on fire 
You're on fire
