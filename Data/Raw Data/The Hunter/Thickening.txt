With the lights down low 
Wrapped up like a baby 
And your hair hangs long 
Surrounding my face

Straight out of nowhere 
Buried deep inside my past 
Straight out of nowhere 
Hoping you'll be the last

Love your warm embrace 
Hold me close, don't let me go 
Nipple pink and cold 
Filled up with mother's milk
