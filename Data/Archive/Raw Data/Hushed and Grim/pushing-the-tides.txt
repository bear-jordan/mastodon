I think I'm ready to start 
I thought I heard you scream 
We're all part of this fucked up devastation (Go)
Always spinning the wheels 
A greater vision in sight 
It's not failure if you're trying

Another prick of a thorn 
The body reaches deep 
As I choke the situation 
Seeming clever and wise 
Clouded beyond the dark cells 
I know not what drips inside me

Pushing the tides 
Trying not to go down and taken under 
Pushing the tides 
Try to keep my head above the water

(Go)
You try untying the weight 
And you continue to breathe 
I remove you for protection 
And where to go from here 
A place you value the most 
Such a brilliant realization

Pushing the tides 
Trying not to go down and taken under 
Pushing the tides 
Try to keep my head above the water 
Pushing the tides 
Leading us to prevail

And all we desire

[Brann Dailor]
Pushing the tides 
With every ounce of strength I have
