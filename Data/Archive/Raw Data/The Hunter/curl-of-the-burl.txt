I killed a man cause he killed my goat 
I put my hands around his throat 
He tried to reason with the sky and the clouds 
But it didn't matter, cause they can't hear a sound

It's just the curl of the burl 
That's just the way of the world 
It's just the curl of the burl

Splinters in my skin just like needles and pins 
I cut through the pine, love the feeling it gives 
Been out here for days running through these streets 
I'm using my hands, cutting through the disease

I feed the powerless 
Chew it up, spit the rest

Chew it up, spit the rest
