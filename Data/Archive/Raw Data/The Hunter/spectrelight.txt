We trip the light 
Firebird flies 
Burn your inside 
Given a lesson 
The path I've shown 
Follow all I know 
Into the spectrelight 
Into the afterlife

It came from the ocean 
Gift from the sea 
Lava forms the stone 
Belief in power 
Believe the dream 
Trust your own truth 
Into the spectrelight 
Into the afterlife

You listen through the light 
Tolling on the sea 
Barren eyes behind you 
Leave the shadows waking dreams

Rising through the door 
Writing with a knife 
Cut speech, cut light 
Cut chord and break the dawning wretch of silence

Trust your own truth 
Souls of the fallen 
Death of the Godhead 
Listen and breathe 
Into the spectrelight 
Into the afterlife
