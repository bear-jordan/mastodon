I'm a man and that's who I am 
And I'll tell you that to your face 
I'm from the clouds and I shine like the moon 
And I'm here to fuck up the place 
Make it last, make it count 
One more 'round and I'll see you outside 
Heaven knows life can turn on a dime 
So lets enjoy our time

They have got me hanging upside down, again 
Once more 'round the sun we go again

What's the meaning of life that we lead when 
We're caught up in the race 
My heart is spinning like a merry-go-round 
And I want you to take a ride 
I know it's rough and I know that you are weary 
But its nice once you step inside 
Roll me over and turn me around and lets make up on time

They have got me hanging upside down, again 
I just want to melt into the sun again 
Once more 'round the sun we go again
