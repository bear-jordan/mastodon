The demon skin is covered in fine mist 
Opened his hand in my hand 
Holding my eyes to the future 
Hovering above myself 
Letting loose the guided 
Punching these holes in my head 
The space time paradigm

Finding you 
These wild hearts run 
Even deeper 
Burning through

Letting me free the quintessence 
In fine mist 
Opened his hand in center 
Holding my eyes to the future 
Hovering above myself 
Letting loose the guided 
Punching these holes in my head 
Losing my skin to the landslide
