You let the wind take us down 
You let the storm come and wipe us out 
I saw the fog snuff you out 
I saw the ocean come take you under 
I have my boots stuck in your mouth 
I'll have you screaming for your last breath, yeah 
I'll shove them both deep inside 
Patiently waiting for deep devour

You take the high road down 
I'll take the ground below you 
You take the high road down 
I'll take the ground below

You are the one who nobody likes 
You are the plague that was brought here by rats 
I'd like to hunt you, that's fact 
Watching you fade out and never go back
