You call for reasons 
It turns me inside out 
There's no direction 
No ebb and flow 
You call them rejects 
They're all I have 
The mills of life 
They will grind you down

I see a vision 
Chew it with my teeth 
Believe the dying 
And minds that read 
A change in season 
Your mind crawls black 
Turning neurotic 
A self attack

The beast is vicious 
Turns your pale face green 
And keep the search on for mystery 
You told a secret 
Confide into the trees 
Thinking you know a man's history

Fall into pieces 
I swear we're done 
You stick with me and prevail as one 
Fall into pieces 
I swear we're done 
You stick with me and prevail as one
