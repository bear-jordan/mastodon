Ice god shakes the earth
Destruction of the path
Sinking deeper in the snow
Eating bark with blackened hands
Swollen fingers frozen jaw
Warm teeth wrapped around my wrist

Frostbite eating away at our limbs
Slit the belly brontotherium
Climb towards vermilion snowbank fall
Station of the crosses prayer save all

Chewing bone
Euphoria
Land and sky
Shining skull

Ice field blanket land
Hunted beyond the fray
No direction known
Running with the band
Provisions wearing thin
Avalanche sweeps the land

Starvation setting in
Spilling all that's left
Should've kept the fruits from virgin's vine
Three-horned face
Pillar of red
Evil lives atop my crooked spine

Rosebush current flow
Carmine river go
Solar storms erupt on the sun
Ice fields blanket land

Snow queen
Hypothermia
Ice lips
Hallucination

Ice field blanket land
Hunted beyond the fray
No direction known
Running with the band
Provisions wearing thin
Avalanche sweeps the land

Landscape ebb 'n' flow
Think I felt the end of time
Skulls aglow as crystal shines
And starts to warm the empty climb
