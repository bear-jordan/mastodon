Hand of stone
Arm of strength
Nature's fire
Fist of gold

Venom stains the lips and burns the tongue
With vengeance and hatred
Extremities forged in nature's fire
Unrelenting vigor
Carve the future

Feast or famine
Drink deception
The wells run dry
The need for temptation

The hand matches
The hand that leads the way
To kill the shepherd
Just to see his face
Heed the warning
Ingest the rotten bone
The hand that falters
The hand that turns to stone

Chew on the root that gives us sight
Cranium shatters
Feed the needles as they fall
The truth
The mask
Brain divided
