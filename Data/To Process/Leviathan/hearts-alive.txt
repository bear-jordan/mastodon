Taken down with hearts alive
Our hearts alive
@3:08

@3:26
[Troy Sanders]
Lurking dark underground
Descend to the bottom
Swim below eternally
Into the deep blue sea
@3:44

@4:00
[Troy Sanders]
Time and space
All alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes
Opening up
I can't stand
I can't breathe
@4:18

@4:48
[Troy Sanders]
Rolled fin out
Oil stripped
Hold is filled
@5:00

@5:17
[Troy Sanders]
Ocean coil
Water boils
He swims to the surface
Flame from mouth
Smoke he breathes
Enter the caverns of the deep
@5:37

@5:52
[Troy Sanders]
Time and space
All alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes
Opening up
I can't stand
I can't breathe
@6:10

@6:38
[Troy Sanders]
Terrified
Ghastly cry
Spiraled lives
Taken down
Taken down
@6:59

@8:30
[Troy Sanders]
The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she
Not for defeat
@8:51

@9:33
[Troy Sanders]
The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she
