Show yourself 
Show yourself 
I want to see everything you're made of 
Tear it down and rip it out 
Shed your skin and float it down the river 
Lose yourself 
Lose yourself 
Wild horses ride you through the valley 
Come alive 
Come alive 
Sail into the void without your worries

You're not as safe as far as I can tell 
And I can tell 
Only you can save yourself 
Soon this will all be a distant memory 
Or could this dream be real at all?

Stars align 
Stars align 
Stars can fall and get you into trouble 
Be afraid 
Don't be afraid 
Speak the ancient wisdom of the desert

Show yourself Show yourself 
I wanna see everything you're made of 
Reveal yourself 
Reveal yourself 
The truth will send a ripple through your body 
See your fate 
You'll see your fate 
Death will come and steal you from the living 
Dead and gone 
Dead and gone 
I'll see you on the other side of fire
