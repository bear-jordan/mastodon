Diamond in the wishing well 
Falling underneath the spell 
Save me from the wicked ways 
Pulling me with all its weight 
High above the silver line 
Flying over burning ground 
Ringing bells with golden chains 
Resonating with the sound 
Siren sounded 
I didn't hear it 
Travel deep within the mine 
Never want to cross the line 
Found the one I'd never sell 
One I thought I'd never find 
Searching through the layers of filth 
Feeling where the light is from 
Always licking off the bone 
Carve a way to our home 
Siren sounded 
I didn't hear it 
Voices warned 
I'd not heed it

I fell into a pit of lies 
I tried to dig around the other side 
And much to my surprise 
I was to blame for all the rain

I was to blame for all the rain
