I flew beyond the sun before it was time 
Burning all the gold that held me inside my shell 
Waiting for you to pull me back in 
I almost had the world in my sight

Lost love, bright eyes fading 
Faster than stars falling 
How can I tell you that I've failed? 
Tell you I failed

Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song 
Now I'm lost in oblivion

I tried to burrow a hole into the ground 
Breaking all the fingers and the nails from my hands 
The eyes of a child see no wrong 
Ignorant bliss, impending doom
