Wrathful ones nine eyes gaze 
Holding skulls 
Filled and laced 
With human blood

Shades of darkened skies
Emptiness
Twilight holding through
Offering
Life in zenith
Bulls blood shot eyes
Flattened portrait of the night sky
Feel crust hum
Facing the North
Vapor space
Between heaven and Earth
Wisdom and the knower
A planet collide
Divisible we fall
Hear dirt waves
Wading forth
Vapor space
How long has it been since we flew through the shadows
I have walked on many other planets

Sinister twin
Choking on fear
Bonded iron
Sink to the core
Hear dirt waves
Wading forth
Vapor space
