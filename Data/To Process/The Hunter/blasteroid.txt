Change your hair, change your clothes 
I'll rearrange your face for you 
If you can breathe when 
I am through 
I'll give it all right back to you

I want to drink some fucking blood 
I want to break some fucking glass 
I want to squeeze you till you're inside out 
I want it all

Change your name, change your eyes 
Become the one who 
I despise 
If you are sad and need to cry 
Then turn around and go outside
