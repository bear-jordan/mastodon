Head down, running from the beast 
Breakneck speed taking all my breath 
Black feet scrapped and scarred and dripping blood 
Rain come down, take me with your flood

I came to and I was running from you 
Feel your breath on the back of my neck

Where have I come to be?
Is this all that's left for me?

I wish that I was still there 
I want to keep on breathing 
Bulls roar loud, snakes move past my feet 
No teeth, no hands, set me free 
Bones start rattling 'round inside my head 
I don't know if I'm alive or dead

Dig deep, kicking up rock and dirt and sand 
Out of this lifeless valley, bones in hand 
Over these mountains to the seas of life 
Leave this desert for the sick and damned
