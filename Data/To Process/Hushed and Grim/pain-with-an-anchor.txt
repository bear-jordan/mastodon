Oh, my dear 
Look what we've done here 
My greatest fear 
A pain with an anchor 
The taste of defeat 
Oh, my dear 
Look what we've come to 
We've shattered serene

I've turned the grief to medicine 
Into my mouth will enter 
The hardest pill 
I've ever had to swallow down 
As karma whispers

Oh, my dear 
The damage is done here I disappear 
A love with no anchor 
In the depths of the sea

I've turned the grief to medicine 
Into my mouth will enter 
The hardest pill
