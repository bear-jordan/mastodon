The night I went under 
And there was no one around 
Nothing to swim to 
Not the sky, not the ground 
I heard you speak to me 
And said to just go down

@1:27
[Brann Dailor] 
Swept away 
In peaceful tranquility 
I wish that I could stay 
@1:46

@1:51
[Brent Hinds] 
And I keep on waiting 
For someone to save me 
I keep waiting for someone to ask me
What is your name?

[Brann Dailor] 
Swept away 
In peaceful tranquility 
I wish that I could stay

I've seen worse before 
I've had trouble breathing 
I've had scrapes and scars
Healing from lacerations 
Bending from days on end 
I get up and walk away 
@3:01

@3:14
[Brann Dailor] 
Through all the lies I told before 
Well, now, they've all come true
Never mind this screaming in the cold 
@2:26

@2:34
[Brann Dailor]
And when I caught a glimpse of you 
You were laughing at me and looking away 
And I did everything I could 
To try to get you to stay 
@3:53

[Brent Hinds] 
I pass through dimensions 
And leaving this plane 
Turning into the ether 
It changes everything

@4:50
[Brann Dailor]
Swept away 
In peaceful tranquility 
I wish that I could stay

[Troy Sanders] 
I can't hear at all 
I've had trouble speaking 
Will this heal my heart?
Relive the never-ending 
Bending for days on end 
I'll get up and walk away
