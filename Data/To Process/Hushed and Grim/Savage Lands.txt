Running from an endless source of everlasting light 
Stumble into darkness of my own creation 
Navigate this maze of self-destruction's inner glow 
Worship at the feet of primal gods of chaos

The walls we create 
The cracks will begin to show 
And watch them start to fall 
All is indefinite 
How quickly we evaporate 
To memories and only dreams 
As the seismic shifts 
Veering into unknown space 
Where monuments will bare your name

Drinking from reflections in the pool of endless doubt 
Continue on the path of reckless devastation 
In the pit of death and bones and carcasses decayed 
It's here I find a guiding hand to true salvation

Push through the pain 
Developing calloused hands 
To dig, scrape and claw 
Thought and visions stick 
The images, how they still burn 
Cementing of your legacy 
Now it's flooding back 
Trigger the unlocking fate 
To wash away and letting free
Dredging the weight 
Dragging through hollow ground 
To break the chain of lies'
Round and 'round, we battle ourselves 
Silencing our tongues
